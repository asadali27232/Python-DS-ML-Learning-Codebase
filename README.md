# Python-DS-ML-Learning-Codebase
A comprehensive repository to acquire the skills necessary to excel in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning

## Motive
Throughout this track, I will focus on using Python for data science, starting with the basics and progressing to more advanced topics such as machine learning. Iâ€™ll cover a broad range of areas, including data manipulation, visualization, and analysis, using popular Python libraries such as pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

As I progress, Iâ€™ll work through interactive exercises using real-world datasets to help me test my abilities and develop my skills. These examples will help me explore various statistical and machine-learning techniques, including hypothesis testing and predictive modeling. Iâ€™ll also gain an understanding of package development, data preprocessing, SQL for relational databases, Git for data science projects, and more.

Let's embark on this exciting journey of becoming a Data Scientist Professional with Python!
