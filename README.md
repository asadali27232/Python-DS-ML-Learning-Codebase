# Python-DS-ML-Learning-Codebase
A comprehensive repository to acquire the skills necessary to excel in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning

## Motive
Throughout this track, I will focus on using Python for data science, starting with the basics and progressing to more advanced topics such as machine learning. I’ll cover a broad range of areas, including data manipulation, visualization, and analysis, using popular Python libraries such as pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

As I progress, I’ll work through interactive exercises using real-world datasets to help me test my abilities and develop my skills. These examples will help me explore various statistical and machine-learning techniques, including hypothesis testing and predictive modeling. I’ll also gain an understanding of package development, data preprocessing, SQL for relational databases, Git for data science projects, and more.

Let's embark on this exciting journey of becoming a Data Scientist Professional with Python!
